# Heart-Disease-Data-EDA-and-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-Models

Overview

The data, originating from 1988, consists of information from four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. Initially comprising 76 attributes, the experiments primarily utilize a subset of 14 attributes. The 'target' field denotes the presence of heart disease in patients, encoded as integer values (0 = no disease, 1 = disease).

Attributes

age: Age of the patient

sex: Gender of the patient

chest pain type: Categorized into 4 values

resting blood pressure: Patient's resting blood pressure

serum cholesterol: Cholesterol levels in mg/dl

fasting blood sugar: Indicates whether fasting blood sugar is > 120 mg/dl

resting electrocardiographic results: Values 0, 1, 2 representing different results

maximum heart rate achieved: Maximum heart rate during the test

exercise-induced angina: Presence of angina induced by exercise

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope of the peak exercise ST segment

number of major vessels: Vessels colored by flourosopy (0-3)

thal: Categorized as 0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect
